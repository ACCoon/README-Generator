# README-Generator
## Description
A Node command-line application to generate clear, clean README files based on user input in terminal.

## Usage
With Node installed, simply navigate to the application directory and use the command: node index.js. From there, a series of questions will be asked prompting the user for input per the details of their project. These details are then used to generate a README markdown file that is then saved to the output directory using the given project's name for the filename.
